# Fishtoys

Viewers can use tokens to interact with the tank in super unique ways using Fishtoys. You may want to send your favorite contestant a plushie, or perhaps you want to swap out the contents of the freezer and fridge. By using Fishtoys, you can potentially change the dynamics of the tank, declare war on rival clans using [Wartoys](https://fishtanklive.mintlify.app/pages/site/fishtoys#wartoys), as well as gain access to extremely intimate experiences using [Bigtoys](https://fishtanklive.mintlify.app/pages/site/fishtoys#bigtoys).&#x20;

## Sending Fishtoys

Fishtoys can be accessed by selecting the 'Fishtoy' button at the bottom of the chat window:

## Wartoys
