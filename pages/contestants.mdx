## Contestants

Contestants for each season of Fishtank.live are selected and brought to the tank for an experience of their lifetime.&#x20;

## Freeloaders

Freeloaders are a unique aspect of Fishtank.live's reality show, bringing in various personalities who are not competing in the competition with the rest of the Contestant Fish. They can be unknown parties or well-known online anomalies, but either way, their goal is to disrupt the Fish's regular routine and add spice to the competition for everyone involved.
