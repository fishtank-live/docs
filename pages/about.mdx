The premise of the show is observing a group of [contestants](https://fishtanklive.mintlify.app/pages/contestants) that are confined to a house for six weeks (or 42 days) competing for a cash prize. They are subjected challenge competitions, social experiments, and real-time audience vitriol or praise. Viewers can interact with contestants through **SFX** ([sound effects), TTS (text-to-speech)](https://fishtanklive.mintlify.app/pages/site/tts-sfx), and even [physically affect conditions in the house through Fishtoys](https://fishtanklive.mintlify.app/pages/site/fishtoys). Contestants get kicked off, driven to quit, or eliminated until the last day comes and only one remains as the winner.
