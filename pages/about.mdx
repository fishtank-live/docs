**_Fishtank_**, also known as **F*ishtank.live***, is an interactive reality competition web series created in 2023 by Sam Hyde, Benjamin Taylor, and Jet Neptune. The premise of the show is observing a group of [contestants](https://fishtanklive.mintlify.app/pages/contestants) that are confined to a house for six weeks (or 42 days). They are subjected challenge competitions, social manipulation, and real-time audience vitriol. Viewers can interact with contestants through [sound effects, TTS (text-to-speech) donations](https://fishtanklive.mintlify.app/pages/site/tts-sfx), and even [physically affect conditions in the house through Fishtoys](https://fishtanklive.mintlify.app/pages/site/fishtoys). Contestants get kicked off, driven to quit, or eliminated until the last day comes and only one remains as the winner.
