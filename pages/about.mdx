[**_Fishtank_**](https://fishtanklive.fandom.com/wiki/Fishtank "Fishtank"), also known as **_fishtank.live_**, is an interactive reality competition webseries created in 2023 by [Sam Hyde](https://fishtanklive.fandom.com/wiki/Jason_Goldstriker "Jason Goldstriker"), [Benjamin Taylor](https://fishtanklive.fandom.com/wiki/Ben "Ben"), and [Jet Neptune](https://fishtanklive.fandom.com/wiki/Jet "Jet"). The premise of the show is observing a group of contestants that are confined to a house for six weeks (or 42 days). They are subjected challenge competitions, social manipulation, and real-time audience vitriol. Viewers can interact with contestants through sound effects, TTS (text-to-speech) donations, and even physically affect conditions in the house through _fishtoys_. Contestants get kicked off, driven to quit, or eliminated until the last day comes and only one remains as the winner.
